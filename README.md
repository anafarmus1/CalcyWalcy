# CalcyWalcy
*A simple calculator for fundamental plane analytic geometry and calculus I topics*

Problem - I thought I liked math. I thought math liked me. Then I met Purdue Math Department...

Solution - Coding is fun, calculus, not so much. When approaching challenging concepts, passion for the subject is integral (pun intended) to success!
I can hit two birds with one stone by learning one through the other. This will be a messy project, but I can't wait to dive in! 

## On the Docket
### Starting off with a warm-up: a simple limit calculator.
- Accepts f(x) as input and a value "a" where the limit as x approaches a of (f)x will be calculated
- Attempts direct substitution
- If failure or division by zero occurs, tries factoring techniques
- Uses L'Hopital's rule for indeterminate forms
- Handles infinite limits/limits at infinity

#### Here's what I'm aiming to learn:
- Manual math expression parsing
- Tokenization, shunting-yard algorithm, expression trees
- Error handling
- Eventually, will implement ux features to transition from a personal experiment to a cleaner, usable interface
